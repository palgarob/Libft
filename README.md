# Libft

> C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be
helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.

This is the first project of the 42 cursus curriculum. Here can be found some of the
basic functions of the C standard library, reimplemented, in order to get a deeper
understanding of how the C programming language works. [Here](https://github.com/palgarob/libft-improved)
is an improved version of the libft with additional custom made functions that I have
used for other projects of the 42 cursus.
